## Overview

This is a documentation of the YouGotaGift.com Corporate Rewards API 1.0

### API Older Version Links
[Version 0.4](https://github.com/YouGotaGift/docs/blob/master/corporate-rewards-API-v0.4.md)

[Version 0.3](https://github.com/YouGotaGift/docs/blob/master/corporate-rewards-API-0.3.md)

[Version 0.2](https://github.com/YouGotaGift/docs/blob/master/corporate-rewards-API-0.2.md)

### Changes
Added support for international brands which requires additional details for redemption. Eg: Code, Redemption URL, PIN etc..

### Summary of changes
* Removed "code" , instead introduced "gift_voucher" which provides all the important gift card details eg: code, redemption url, Pin etc..  
* Removed "pdf_link" since "gift_pdf_link" has been introduced in 0.4 to provide a direct gift pdf download link.
* Removed "excel_link" since this functionality is currently not used by any user. Might introduce later when the need arises.
* Removed "total_amount" since the gift amount already holds the value
* Removed "count" since it always returns 1 and more than one quantity is not allowed
* "gifts_json" key returned by download endpoint has been renamed to "gift_json"

### How It Works

The YouGotaGift.com Corporate Rewards API is an HTTP API, you can call it with simple HTTP GET/POST, and the result will be in JSON.

### API Endpoints
* All the following API endpoints are available under `https://yougotagift.com/corporate/api/`.
* All the API points return JSON responses.
* All the API points are callable using HTTP methods, some will only accept `GET` requests, some will only accept `POST` requests, and some will accept both.
* Authentication is done using HTTP Basic Authentication over TLS secured channel in HTTPS.
* The HTTP Response Code will tell you whether your call was successful or not.
* `HTTP 200` Means everything went okay.
* `HTTP 201` Means Resource created.
* `HTTP 404` Means the object you were accessing does not exist.
* `HTTP 403` Means Forbidden, the requested is hidden for administrators only.
* `HTTP 405` Means Request Method Not Allowed.
* `HTTP 400` Bad Request – Inavllid or malformed request, Means that you have an error in your request, the JSON content will have `errors` field which will explain what is the issue.
* `HTTP 50x` Internal Server Error, something went wrong from server side, we'll resolve it ASAP.
